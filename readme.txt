Fade-in content, possibly over a background image, with shortcodes [fadein] and [fadeinbackground].

== Description ==

Easily add fade-in's to your posts, pages and custom posts using the shortcode [fadein].

The [fadein] shortcode has "delay" and "duration" attributes that allow you to set the delay and duration of the fade-in in seconds.

Here are the attributes that both the [fadein] and [fadeinbackground] shortcode have these attributes:
<ul>
<li>backgroundimage - the url of an image file (e.g.http://example.com/image.jpg)</li>
<li>backgroundimageopacity - the opacity of the background image (e.g. 20%)</li>
<li>padding - the padding around the shortcode's content (e.g. 100, 100px, 10%, auto)</li>
<li>backgroundcolor - the background color of the shortcode which is displayed over any background image (e.g. blue)</li>
<li>backgroundcoloropacity - the opacity of the background color which is displayed over any background image (e.g. 20%)</li>
<li>backgroundfit - if you set backgroundfit to "tile" then the background image will be tiled</li>
<li>textcolor - the text color of the shortcode's content (e.g. #ffffff)</li>
</ul>
